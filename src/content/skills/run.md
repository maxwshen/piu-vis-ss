Runs, or streams, are a series of notes (here, defined as 7 or more notes) at constant rhythm. Unlike drills which alternate between just two panels, runs involve a variety of panels, which in doubles can require you to move around the pads. In most arcade-length charts, the crux is an ending run, between 5 seconds to 25 seconds long. 8th note runs at 100 BPM to 200 BPM correspond to ~3.3 notes per second (NPS) to ~6.7 NPS and are found at S6~S14. 16th note runs at 100 BPM to 200+ BPM, or ~6.7 NPS to ~13.3+ NPS start to be introduced at S16 and beyond.
