A doubles cross-pad transition pattern, which either uses all red and yellow arrows: <span class="icon-up-left"></span>-<span class="icon-center"></span>-<span class="icon-up-right"></span>-<span class="icon-up-left"></span>-<span class="icon-center"></span>-<span class="icon-up-right"></span>, or all blue and yellow arrows: <span class="icon-down-left"></span>-<span class="icon-center"></span>-<span class="icon-down-right"></span>-<span class="icon-down-left"></span>-<span class="icon-center"></span>-<span class="icon-down-right"></span>. These transitions are common in co-op charts, as they allow the players to pass each other.
