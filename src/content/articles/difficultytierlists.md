These difficulty tier lists are predicted using features like run length, twistiness, movement, and speed, and certain skills like double stepping, jacks, and brackets. Notably, the model only uses patterns - it does not "know" about the life bar when predicting difficulty, so it is not always aligned with stage pass difficulty.

As such, take these predicted difficulty tier lists with a grain of salt. For lv. 20+, Chabala difficulty tier lists are more useful. Historically, lower levels have suffered from a lack of useful difficulty tier lists. We hope this attempt to provide approximate difficulty tier lists for *all* levels can be useful for some players.

These tier lists are under construction to try to improve their usefulness. If you are interested in helping or contributing, reach out on the [piucenter discord](https://discord.gg/aHbZsk7j2U).
