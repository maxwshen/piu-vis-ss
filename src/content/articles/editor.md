# Editor: Chart annotations & chart jsons

piucenter enables you to edit chart annotations from the defaults, including:

- Marking foot annotations (left foot / right foot)
- Mark arrows as miss

Together, this lets you create custom "maps" for executing stepcharts in different ways.

You can save your chart jsons to file, share them with others on the [piucenter discord](https://discord.gg/aHbZsk7j2U), and view chart jsons using the [upload page](/upload).

Desktop, not mobile, is strongly suggested for using the lifebar calculator.
