# Defeating plateaus via fine-grained progress with footspeed & time under tension

<div class="tip">
Due to inconsistent grading, stepchart levels can have large jumps in actual difficulty.

In this article, I discuss how footspeed (measured in *notes per second*) and stamina (measured by *sustain time*, or *time under tension*) are objective metrics that enable more fine-grained, incremental improvement than stepchart level.

I'll also provide tips and recommendations on how to best improve these skills.

Notes per second and sustain time are major determinants of stepchart level: faster footspeed and higher stamina increase a stepchart's graded level.

### Notes per second increases gradually

There are a couple of key properties of notes per second that makes it a fundamental metric for improvement. Notes per second varies smoothly, and NPS is covered densely by stepcharts. Together, this means that at nearly any NPS value, you can find stepcharts that are just 0.1 NPS faster -- ever-so-slightly faster -- and use that to improve your footspeed. 

<div class="note">
In fact, you can build a sequence of stepcharts all 0.1 NPS apart that starts at beginner-level 1 NPS and goes all the way to top-level 15 NPS. This is a sequence of 150 different NPS values, enabling very gradual progression, compared to only 26 distinct singles levels.

<div class="tip">
Piucenter makes it easy to find stepcharts at any NPS value on the <a href=/search>search</a> page.

This is particularly useful when crossing thresholds such as between 8th notes and 16th notes, where BPM has a more complicated relationship with NPS. For example, at S13, low BPM charts like Butterfly (128 BPM) have higher NPS than higher BPM charts like Crossing Delta (180 BPM), because Butterfly S13 uses 16th notes while Crossing Delta S13 uses 8th notes.

### Sustain time also increases gradually

Here, I've plotted the sustain time, which is the time-length of the longest run at a chart's representative NPS, for charts with ~10 NPS. There are 300 charts with ~10 NPS, starting from very low sustain time, then incrementing by 1 second at a time, up to 35s+ sustain time.

While sustain time is not quite as fine-grained as NPS, it is perhaps the most conceptually straightforward skill to improve on in pump. If you can handle a 5-second run at a certain NPS, you can try to improve your physical stamina to last for 6 seconds, then push for 7 seconds, and so on - each time, you are primarily doing more of what you've already done.

<div class="tip">
Total time under tension is another useful metric for improving stamina. Sustain time measures the time-length of the longest run in a stepchart, while time under tension measures the total amount of time spent at the target NPS during a stepchart. Most stepcharts have short breaks in between runs, so improving your time under tension can also mean learning to rest more effectively, and executing target-NPS runs without being fully fresh.
</div>

Piucenter makes it easy to find stepcharts at your target NPS with your target sustain time in the [search](/search) page. Total time under tension is reported on the NPS timeline column in each chart's page.

## Recommendations on progressive improvement

### What makes a good progression plan?
Let's say you're an ~S18 player. An intuitive way to improve footspeed is to practice S18 or S17 charts with higher BPM. In the following image, this strategy is a "vertical" slice: you consider only 1 or 2 different levels, and try to move up the y-axis. 

What's likely not ideal about this tactic is that you're moving from higher pattern complexity to lower complexity as you increase NPS for a given level, as well as decreasing sustain time. This strategy changes a lot of things, making it harder to focus on improvement.

Summary of fixing chart-level and increasing NPS:
- <span style="color:#7CB82Fdd">NPS: increases ✅</span>
- <span style="color:#ec433980">Sustain time: decreases ❌</span>
- <span style="color:#ec433980">Complexity: decreases ❌</span>

In my opinion, a good progression arc should improve your abilities in NPS, sustain time, and complexity. Over the course of the progression arc, ideally:

- <span style="color:#7CB82Fdd">NPS: increases or maintained</span>
- <span style="color:#7CB82Fdd">Sustain time: increases or maintained</span>
- <span style="color:#7CB82Fdd">Complexity: increases or maintained</span>

A *focused* progression plan would increase only one skill, while maintaining the others.

### Improving sustain time and complexity, for a fixed NPS

One progression plan is:

1. Pick an NPS you want to practice.
2. Starting from very low sustain time, work your way up by increasing sustain time, which also generally increases pattern complexity.

You can implement this plan using our [search](/search) page, where you can filter charts to a specific NPS range, and sort charts by sustain time.

![alt-text](/images/piu-singles-nps-sustain-level-edited-highlighted.png)

This typically means you'll be increasing levels as well, making it a horizontal strategy, though the idea is to progress according to sustain time regardless of the level of the chart (there are misratings, after all).

Summary of fixing NPS and increasing sustain time:
- <span style="color:#efb920dd">NPS: maintained</span>
- <span style="color:#7CB82Fdd">Sustain time: increases ✅</span>
- <span style="color:#7CB82Fdd">Complexity: increases ✅</span>

In official Pump charts, the simplest patterns to introduce an NPS are typically three notes in a row, sometimes referred to as a triplet (though this isn't actually a "musical triplet"). Then, five notes in a row, which is a short [drill](/skill/drill). As you move to seven notes in a row and beyond, the sustain time will increase from bursts shorter than 1 second, to slightly longer bursts. Official Pump charts start to expand beyond drills to [anchor runs](/skill/anchor_run) and [runs without twists](/skill/run_without_twists). With increasing sustain time, pattern complexity further increases: twists generally become common when runs near ~10 seconds, with even longer runs becoming twistier.

If you make UCS, you can obtain even more fine-grained improvement by separating sustain time from pattern complexity.

### Improving footspeed, with fixed sustain time and complexity

In this plan, we fix sustain time and complexity to get focused practice on footspeed.

1. Pick a sustain time and degree of complexity. Very short sustain times, under 1 second, might not offer enough useful feedback, so perhaps try ~3-5 seconds or more. You can control complexity in piucenter by searching for charts tagged with "run without twists", etc.
2. Work your way up by increasing NPS.

You can implement this plan using our [search](/search) page, where you can filter charts to a specific sustain time range, add filters to control complexity such as skill filters, and then sort charts by NPS. It can also be useful to filter to a minimum NPS or minimum level.

Summary:
- <span style="color:#7CB82Fdd">NPS: increases ✅</span>
- <span style="color:#efb920dd">Sustain time: maintained </span>
- <span style="color:#efb920dd">Complexity: maintained </span>

This would generally be a "up-right diagonal" progression on this figure, though again, recall that the idea is to progress according to NPS regardless of the chart level.

In conclusion:

- Official level ratings can be inconsistently graded, and there can be huge jumps in difficulty between consecutive levels. [Difficulty tier lists](/articles/difficultytierlists) are commonly used because the difference between the easiest chart and hardest chart in the same level can be large. This makes difficulty levels alone a poor metric for measuring ability and improvement.
- Stepcharts typically mix lots of different skills. Focusing on your aggregate score muddles your ability to quantify improvement on individual skills. Instead, try to get more specific feedback on particular sections or short patterns that are most relevant to you.
- Footspeed and stamina are more fundamental skills, which are objectively quantifiable in a chart using notes per second, and sustain time and time under tension. These metrics are easily searchable in piucenter.
- NPS and sustain time smoothly vary, enabling progressive improvement.
- A focused progression arc focuses on improving one or two of: NPS, sustain time, complexity.
